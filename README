# Description

PHP site consisting of two pages which are linked and connect to a local mySQL database

We can log in to the first page by solving a famous riddle, once inside the hall we can add our name to the wall of adventurers and set a new passphrase
so that we can enter again at our leisure

# Improvements I would like to make:

- shore up the page security so that I cannot access the wall without login auth, and can never access the connection page
- separate the html sections from php scripts into new files
- jazz up the pages with CSS and better HTML styling

# Install

- Clone the repo and open the parent folder
- Run `docker-compose build && docker-compose up`

- - note the pre-requisite of having docker installed on your system
